features:
  - add ``seed`` argument to ``subgraph.find_subgraph`` to randomize algorithm (issue #243)
  - add support for non-injective homomorphisms in ``subgraph.find_embedding`` through new ``injectivity`` argument
fixes:
  - argument list made explicit rather than over-reliance on ``kwargs`` (issue #255)
  - proper support for nodes without incident edges (issue #254)
